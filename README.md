perappu
=======

My random sentence generator from Intro to Computer Science. It is named after the Pok&#233;mon Chatot (Japanese: _Perappu_), which is capable of mimicking human speech.

### How to use perappu:
- `(sentence)` returns a randomly generated sentence formatted as a list of symbols and strings.
- `(main i)` prints `i` randomly generated sentences to `STDOUT` using the `(sentence)` function.
